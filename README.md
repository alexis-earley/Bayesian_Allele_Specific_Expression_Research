Project overview:

This project was centered around allele specific expression, which is when the allele from one parent is expressed more than another. This can be used for applications such as evolutionary biology, cancer, and immunology. I worked with a number of others to create Python scripts for this purpose. Using XML scripts we designed, researchers could run Galaxy, an open-source biomedical research website, using buttons and drop down menus. This allowed biologists without much programming knowledge to use the tool. I earned an acknowledgement on a paper from my work on this project.

A couple of examples of files that I helped with are:
- Check Align Design File (check_aln_design_file.py) - This Python file ensures that the biological files contain the proper headers, names, and are otherwise in the correct format for analysis.
- Merge Priors (merge_priors_to_comparate.xml) - This XML file is one step in the pipeline that takes the result of previous statistical tests and merges them with other filtered data.
